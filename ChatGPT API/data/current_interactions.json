The CR-V is known for its comfortable ride, good fuel economy (25-31 mpg), and a strong resale value. It starts at around $24,000.\n\n2. **Toyota RAV4**: Another popular option in the compact SUV segment, the RAV4 offers a spacious interior, advanced safety features (like adaptive cruise control), and decent fuel economy (26-35 mpg). Prices start at around $25,000.\n\n3. **Subaru Forester**: If you prioritize all-wheel drive capability and good visibility, the Forester is an excellent choice. It also has a reputation for being one of the safest SUVs on the market, with top-notch crash test ratings. Fuel economy ranges from 24-32 mpg. Prices start at around $25,000.\n\nAll three options are well-regarded in their respective classes and should meet your daily needs comfortably. Which one resonates with you, or would you like me to explore other possibilities?"
